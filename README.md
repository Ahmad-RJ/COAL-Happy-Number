# COAL Happy Number
This is an assembly language program (for INTEL 8088) that takes a 4-digit decimal number as input from user and calculates whether the number is a happy number or unhappy. If the number is a happy number, display ‘Happy’ on the screen else display ‘UnHappy’. A happy number is defined by the following process:
Starting with the given number, replace that number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process on the replaced number until the number either equals 1 within 256 iterations of the process. The number for which this process ends in 1 within 256 iterations is called a happy number, otherwise it is called an unhappy number.
